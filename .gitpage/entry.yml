description : |
  This repository contains a project aimed at standardizing the various implementations of BF machines. 
  The goal is to address the languageâ€™s unspoken shortcoming as an otherwise perfect esolang - the reliance of most "tricks" on the specific configuration of the underlying BF machine.
